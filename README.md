# Goals-App

Basic web app for tracking goals. I'm making this app to practice building a full stack application using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

The app's functionality will include the ability to sign in/out of an account and create, delete, or alter your goals. 

Right now, the app can send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to a mock API via routes protected by JSON Web Tokens.
